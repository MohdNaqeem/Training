=> what is nodeJs?
   Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, typically on the server.

=> How does Node.js work?
   Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, meaning it can handle many requests efficiently 
   without creating multiple threads.

=> What is a Server?
   A server is a computer or program that receives client requests, processes them, and sends back responses (like web 
   pages, data, or files).

=> What is the V8 Engine?
   V8 is Google’s JavaScript engine (used in Chrome and Node.js) that compiles JavaScript directly into machine code so 
   it runs very fast.

=> What is Machine Code?
   Machine code is the lowest-level code made of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that the CPU can execute directly.

=> What is High-Level Code?
   High-level code is human-readable programming code (like JavaScript, Python, Java) that must be translated into 
   machine code before execution.

=> What is ECMAScript?
   ECMAScript is the official standard specification for JavaScript — it defines the language rules and features that 
   ßJavaScript engines (like V8) must follow.

=> What is the Global Object?
   In Node.js, the global object is called global. It contains variables, functions, and objects that are available 
   everywhere in a Node.js program without importing them.

=> How does V8 understand global?
   V8 doesn’t define global. Node creates the global object and exposes it as global inside the V8 execution context, 
   similar to how browsers expose window.

=> What is globalThis?
   globalThis is the standardized way to access the global object across all JavaScript environments, so the same code 
   works in both browsers and Node.js.
