=> What is a Database? (Real definition)
   A database is a structured system for storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently and reliably.

=> Why do we even need a database?
   Without a database:
   - Data dies when the app restarts
   - Files become messy and unsearchable
   - No concurrency control
   - No security
   - No consistency
   A database exists to solve four core problems:
   - Persistence
   - Speed
   - Concurrency
   - Data integrity

=> What is SQL?
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language, not a database.

   Purpose:
   To define, read, insert, update, and delete data in relational databases.

   What SQL does:
   - Create tables
   - Query data
   - Enforce rules (constraints)
   - Manage transactions

=> What is NoSQL?
   NoSQL databases store data in collections, documents, and fields instead of tables. They are designed for unstructured 
   or semi-structured data and support a flexible schema. NoSQL databases are easier to scale horizontally and are 
   commonly used in real-time, big data, and distributed applications like social media and analytics platforms.

   Core idea:
   - Flexible schema
   - Designed for scalability and large data volumes
   - Often distributed

   Examples:
   - MongoDB (document)
   - Redis (key–value)
   - Cassandra (column-family)
   - Neo4j (graph)

   NoSQL does NOT mean “no structure”; it means “no fixed relational schema.”

=> What is a Relational Database?
   RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It stores data in the form of tables with rows and columns. 
   The data is structured, follows a fixed schema, and relationships between tables are managed using foreign keys and 
   joins. RDBMS mainly uses SQL for querying and is commonly used in transaction-heavy and read-heavy applications like 
   banking systems.

=> What is a Non-Relational Database?
   A non-relational database stores data without tables or predefined relationships.

=> What is MongoDB?
   MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data as JSON-like documents (BSON) instead of tables and 
   rows.

   What actually makes MongoDB different:
   - Data is stored as documents, not rows
   - Each document can have different fields
   - No fixed schema enforced by the database
   - Built for horizontal scaling

=> How MongoDB Stores Data (Quick but Important)
   MongoDB structure:
   Database
     └── Collection
           └── Document
   Database → container
   Collection → like a table (but schema-less)
   Document → like a row (but flexible)

   Example:
   {
   "_id": 1,
   "name": "Ali",
   "skills": ["JS", "Node"],
   "address": { "city": "Mumbai" }
   }
   "This is not object or json in mongoDb this is document"

=> Why Do People Use MongoDB?
   # Flexible Schema:
     - You don’t need to define columns in advance
     - Fields can be added or removed anytime

     Why this matters:
     - Requirements change
     - Startups move fast
     - Schema migrations are painful in SQL

   # Natural Fit for JavaScript / Node.js
     - Data format ≈ JSON
     - Easy mapping between backend objects and database documents
     - Less transformation code
     That’s why MongoDB is common in Node + Express stacks.

   # Faster Development Speed
     - No complex joins
     - No rigid constraints
     - Less upfront design

   # Handles Large, Unstructured Data Well
     - Logs
     - User activity
     - Product catalogs
     - Content management systems

=> Difference between RDBMS and NoSQL
   - RDBMS uses tables, while NoSQL uses documents or collections
   - RDBMS has a fixed schema, NoSQL has a flexible schema
   - RDBMS uses SQL, NoSQL uses query languages like MongoDB’s MQL
   - RDBMS handles relationships using joins, NoSQL uses nested relationships
   - RDBMS is harder to scale horizontally, NoSQL is easier
   - RDBMS is used in banking and transactional apps, NoSQL is used in real-time and big data systems

   # Why is RDBMS used in banking applications?
     Banking applications require high data consistency, reliability, and transaction safety. RDBMS supports ACID 
     properties, strong relationships, and transaction control, which makes it suitable for financial systems.

   # Why is NoSQL used in real-time and big data applications?
     NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of rapidly changing data. Their flexible schema and horizontal 
     scalability make them suitable for real-time analytics, social media platforms, and distributed systems.
