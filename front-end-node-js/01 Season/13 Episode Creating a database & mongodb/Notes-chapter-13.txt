=> What is MongoDB?
   MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like BSON documents instead of tables and rows.
   It is designed for flexibility, scalability, and high performance, especially for modern web applications.

=> Why MongoDB is called NoSQL?
   MongoDB is called NoSQL because it:
   - Does not use tables, rows, and columns
   - Does not enforce a fixed schema
   - Does not rely on SQL
   - Instead, it stores data as documents inside collections.
   NoSQL does not mean “no structure”, it means no fixed relational structure.

=> How does MongoDB store data?
   MongoDB follows this hierarchy:
   Cluster
    → Database
       → Collection
          → Document
             → Fields

    - Cluster: Group of servers
    - Database: Container for collections
    - Collection: Group of documents
    - Document: JSON-like data object

=> What is a Cluster in MongoDB Atlas?
   A cluster is a managed MongoDB environment hosted on cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP). It handles storage, replication, 
   and scaling. A cluster can contain multiple databases.

=> What is MongoDB Compass?
   MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool used to:
   - View databases and collections
   - Insert, update, delete documents
   - Run queries visually
   MongoDB Compass is NOT a database. It only connects to MongoDB.

=> Why can’t we create an empty database in MongoDB?
   Because MongoDB is schema-less and lazy by design. It only creates databases when actual data or collections exist.

=> What are the two approaches of MongoDB?
   This is a VERY IMPORTANT interview question. MongoDB supports two data modeling approaches:
   - Embedding
   - Referencing
   These decide how related data is stored, not free or paid versions.
