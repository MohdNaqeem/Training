# Episode 03
=> what is nodeJs?
   Node.js is Asynchronous.
   Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, typically on the server.

=> How does Node.js work?
   Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, meaning it can handle many requests efficiently 
   without creating multiple threads.

=> What is a Server?
   A server is a computer or program that receives client requests, processes them, and sends back responses (like web 
   pages, data, or files).

=> What is the V8 Engine?
   V8 is Google’s JavaScript engine (used in Chrome and Node.js) that compiles JavaScript directly into machine code so 
   it runs very fast.

=> What is Machine Code?
   Machine code is the lowest-level code made of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that the CPU can execute directly.

=> What is High-Level Code?
   High-level code is human-readable programming code (like JavaScript, Python, Java) that must be translated into 
   machine code before execution.

=> What is ECMAScript?
   ECMAScript is the official standard specification for JavaScript — it defines the language rules and features that 
   ßJavaScript engines (like V8) must follow.

=> What is the Global Object?
   In Node.js, the global object is called global. It contains variables, functions, and objects that are available 
   everywhere in a Node.js program without importing them.

=> How does V8 understand global?
   V8 doesn’t define global. Node creates the global object and exposes it as global inside the V8 execution context, 
   similar to how browsers expose window.

=> What is globalThis?
   globalThis is the standardized way to access the global object across all JavaScript environments, so the same code 
   works in both browsers and Node.js.

# Episode 04 

=> What is a Module in Node.js?
   A module is simply a separate JavaScript file that contains some code (functions, variables, logic, etc.). Modules help 
   organize code, reuse code, and keep things separate. Every .js file in Node.js is treated as a module.

   # Key points:
     - Each file has its own scope
     - Variables are not global by default
     - You explicitly share things using module.exports

=> What is module.exports?
   module.exports is used to share code from one module (file) to another. Whatever you assign to module.exports becomes 
   available to other files when they import it.

=> What is require()?
   require() is used to import and use a module in another file.

=> Why Node.js uses modules?
   Modules in Node.js help keep code modular, reusable, and maintainable.

=> How do you export from one module to another in Node.js?
   In Node.js, each file is treated as a module. If you want to use code from one file in another file, you must:
   - Export the code from the first file, (using module.exports)
   - Import it in the second file (using require())

=> What are CJS (CommonJS)
   CommonJS is the original Node.js module system that uses require() and module.exports for importing and exporting.
   - Syntax:
   // export
   module.exports = something

   // import
   const something = require('./file')

=> what are ES Modules (ESM / ES6 Modules)?
   ES Modules are the modern, standardized JavaScript module system that use import and export.
   - Syntax:
     // export
     export default something
     export const a = 10;

     // import
     import something from './file.js'
     import { a } from './file.js'

=> Difference between CJS and ES modules.
   - CommonJS:
     CommonJS is the original Node.js module system that uses require() and module.exports. It loads modules synchronously 
     and is mostly used in older Node projects

   - ES Modules
     ES Modules are the modern JavaScript standard using import and export. They support browsers, are always in strict 
     mode, and are now fully supported in Node.js.

=> What is util?
   util is a core Node.js module that provides helper functions for working with callbacks, promises, debugging, type 
   checking, and formatting. It is mainly used to simplify async code and debugging.

=> Why does util exist?
   Because old Node APIs used callbacks, and developers needed helpers to:
   - convert callbacks → promises
   - debug objects
   - detect types
   - format logs

=> What is utils?
   There is no built-in module called utils. Developers often create a folder named utils to store helper functions.

# Episode 05 

=> Why can’t we access functions/variables from one module in another (by default)?
   Node.js isolates each file in its own module scope. That means variables and functions are not global across files. To 
   share them, we explicitly export and import code using module.exports and require().

=> How require() works behind the scenes?
   - When we use require() in Node.js, Node first locates the module file, 
   - Then it secretly wraps that entire file inside an IIFE-style function (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){ ... }).
   - This wrapper gives the module its own scope, so variables and functions don’t leak outside its keep variables and 
     function safe. 
   - The file is then executed, and whatever value we assign to module.exports becomes the exported value.
   - Finally, require() simply returns module.exports, and Node caches the result so the module runs only once.

   # When a module is loaded once, Node remembers it.
     In Node.js, when a module is required for the first time, Node executes the file and stores the exported value in 
     require.cache. Next time we call require() for the same module, Node returns the cached value instead of executing 
     the file again. So each module runs only once.

=> What is Event Driven?
   Node.js uses events and callbacks. When something happens (like a request or file read completion), an event is emitted 
   and the corresponding handler executes.

=> What is Asynchronous?
   Node.js does not wait for slow tasks like file or DB operations. It registers a callback and continues execution. When 
   the task finishes, the callback runs later.

=> What is Synchronous / Blocking?
   Synchronous code blocks the thread — Node must wait for the task to finish before continuing. This is slower and not 
   recommended for servers.

# Episode 06 

=> What is libuv?
   libuv is the engine that makes Node.js asynchronous and non-blocking. libuv is a C library used inside Node.js that 
   handles:
   - the Event Loop
   - asynchronous I/O
   - timers
   - filesystem
   - networking
   - thread pool

=> Why does libuv exist? 
   Because JavaScript is single-threaded, But modern apps need:
   - file reads
   - database calls
   - timers
   - network requests
   - crypto work
   These are slow. If JS ran them directly → app would freeze until they complete.

   # So libuv was created to:
     Offload slow tasks to OS or thread pool, then notify JavaScript when done.

=> What is a Garbage Collector?
   Garbage Collector (GC) is a system that automatically frees memory that your program is no longer using.
   # In simple words:
     - You create variables/objects
     - When they are no longer needed
     - Garbage Collector (GC) deletes them from memoryß
