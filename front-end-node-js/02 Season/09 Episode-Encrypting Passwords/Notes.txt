=> JS Object vs JSON

   # JavaScript Object:
     - Lives in JavaScript memory
     - Used inside code
     - Can contain functions, methods, undefined
     - Flexible, executable

   # JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
     - Plain text format
     - Used for data transfer / storage
     - No functions
     - Strict rules
       - keys should be in quotes
       - functions not allowed
       - undefined not allowed

=> Difference between patch and put:
   PUT = replace the entire resource
   PATCH = update only specific fields

   Feature	             PUT	                   PATCH
   Purpose	             Replace resource	       Update part of resource
   Sends full object	   ✅ Yes	                ❌ No
   Partial update	       ❌ No	                  ✅ Yes
   Risk of data loss.    🔥 High	               Low
   Commonly used	       Rare	                   Very common

   Why PATCH is used more in real projects:
   - Frontend usually updates one or two fields
   - Sending full object every time is risky
   - One missing field in PUT = data wiped
   That’s why: 90% of update APIs use PATCH
   PUT exists mainly for strict REST correctness, not practicality.

=> What is returnDocument?
   returnDocument tells Mongoose which version of the document you want back after an update:
   - before → old data
   - after → updated data

   Example: 

   Suppose this user exists in DB:
   {
     "_id": "abc123",
     "name": "Naqeem",
     "age": 22
   }

   You run an update:
   User.findByIdAndUpdate(
     "abc123",
     { age: 23 },
     { returnDocument: "after" }
   )

   Meaning : “Give me the document after the update is applied.”
   Returned result
   {
     "_id": "abc123",
     "name": "Naqeem",
     "age": 22
   }
   "Even though the DB is updated, the returned value is old."

=> What if you DON’T use returnDocument?
   By default, Mongoose returns the OLD document.

   Option used	     What DB stores	     What function returns
   "before"	         Updated	           Old document
   "after"	         Updated	           Updated document
   Not used	         Updated	           Old document

=> What is runValidators?
   runValidators is an option for update queries in Mongoose. 
   It tells Mongoose: “When I UPDATE a document, also run the schema validators.”
