=> What is Express.js?
   Express.js is a minimal web framework built on top of Node.js that helps you create backend servers and APIs easily.
   Node.js alone can create a server, but it’s low-level and messy. Express makes backend development clean, readable, 
   and scalable.

=> What problem does Express.js solve?
   # Without Express (pure Node.js):
     You manually handle:
     - URLs
     - HTTP methods
     - Parsing data
     - Errors
     - Code becomes hard to manage very fast

   # With Express:
     You get:
     - Routing system
     - Middleware support
     - Clean request/response handling
     - Easy API creation
     That’s why Express exists.

=> What exactly does Express.js do?
   Express helps you:
   - Create a server
   - Define routes (URLs)
   - Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Process request data
   - Send responses
   - Add middleware (auth, logging, validation)

=> Why do we create Express first in a backend project?
   Because Express is the foundation of the backend application.
   When you build a backend, everything depends on:
   - How requests come in
   - How responses go out
   - How APIs are structured
   Express sets up this foundation by:
   - Creating the server
   - Defining routing rules
   - Attaching middleware
   - Handling incoming requests

   Typical backend flow (correct order):
   This is how real projects are structured:
   - Initialize project
   - Create Express app
   - Add middleware
   - Define routes
   - Connect database
   - Add business logic
   - Start server
     
=> What is nodemon?
   nodemon is a development tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server whenever code changes are detected, which 
   improves development speed and removes the need for manual restarts.
