=> How does Express match routes?
   Express matches routes sequentially from top to bottom. The first matching route handles the request.

=> What happens if / route is first?
   It catches all requests and blocks other routes.

=> Does app.use("/test") match /test/123?
   Yes, because app.use matches prefixes.

=> Why should catch-all routes be last?
   Otherwise they block specific routes.

=> Difference between app.use and app.get?
   app.use handles all HTTP methods and prefix matching, while app.get handles only GET requests and exact matching.

   Complete Ans: 
   Express routes are matched sequentially from top to bottom. The first matching route handles the request. Specific 
   routes should come first and generic routes like '/' should come last to avoid blocking other routes.”

=> What is app.use() in Express?
   app.use() is used to register middleware functions in Express. It runs for all HTTP methods and matches routes by 
   prefix, making it useful for global middleware like parsing, authentication, logging, or mounting routers.

=> What is Routing?
   Routing is the process of mapping an incoming client request (URL + HTTP method) to a specific handler function that 
   processes the request and sends a response.

=> How Routing Works Internally?
   - Client sends request
   - Server checks method (GET/POST)
   - Server checks URL
   - Matching route runs
   - Response sent
   - If no match → 404

=> What is the difference between Node routing and Express routing?
   Node.js uses the native HTTP module which requires manual condition checking, while Express provides a routing layer 
   that simplifies route handling.

=> What are HTTP Methods in routing?
   HTTP methods define the type of operation performed on a resource.
   - Method	      Purpose
   - GET	         Read data
   - POST	      Create
   - PUT	         Update
   - DELETE	      Remove
   Example:
   app.get('/users')
   app.post('/users')

=> What is a Route?
   A route is a combination of path + HTTP method + handler function.

=> What are Route Parameters?
   Route parameters are dynamic values embedded in the URL used to capture specific resource identifiers.

=> What are Query Parameters?
   Query parameters are optional key-value pairs passed in the URL to filter or modify request results.

=> Why do we use Router?
   To improve scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

=> What is 404 handling?
   A fallback route that handles unmatched requests.

=> What is a Route Path?
   A route path is the URL pattern that Express uses to match incoming requests.

=> Types of Route Paths in Express.js?
   - Static path
   - String pattern (operators)
   - Regular Expression (regex)

   # Static Path (basic):
     Example: app.get('/about', handler)
     Matches: /about
     Only exact match.

   # String Pattern Paths (operators like ?, +, *)
     These are mini-regex shortcuts. Operators you can use in path:

     - ? (question mark) : Makes the previous character optional.
       Example: app.get('/colou?r', handler)
       Matches: /color , /colour
       Because u is optional

     - + (plus): Matches one or more occurrences of previous character.
       Example: app.get('/go+d', handler)
       Matches: /god , /good , /goood
       Because multiple "o"

     - * (multiply) : Matches zero or more characters.
       Example: app.get('/user*', handler)
       Matches: /user , /user123 , /user/abc , /userXYZ
       Anything allowed

     - () (paranthesis) : Groups characters together. Treat multiple characters as one unit
       Example: app.get('/(cat|dog)', handler)
       Matches: /cat , /dog

   # Regular Expression Routes (Full Power):
     A regular expression route uses JavaScript RegExp to define complex matching rules. Instead of string, you pass 
     regex pattern.
     Example: app.get(/a/, handler)
     Matches: /apple , /cat , /batman
     Matches anything containing "a":
