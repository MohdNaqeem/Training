=> What is LLD?
   LLD (Low Level Design) is the detailed design of how a system is implemented at code level. LLD comes after High 
   Level Design (HLD) and before coding.

=> What LLD focuses on (core idea)?
   LLD focuses on:
   - Classes
   - Methods
   - APIs
   - Data structures
   - Database schema
   - Relationships between components

=> What is included in LLD?
   # Class / Module Design
     - What modules exist
     - Responsibilities of each module
    
   # Method-Level Design
     - Function names
     - Inputs and outputs
     - Business logic steps
     sendConnectionRequest(senderId, receiverId)

   # Database Design (very important)
     - Collections / tables
     - Fields
     - Indexes
     - Relationships

     Example: 
          User {
                 _id,
                 name,
                 email,
                 passwordHash
              }

   # API Design
     - Endpoints
     - HTTP methods
     - Request & response structure
     - Status codes
     POST /api/connections/send

   # Validation & Error Handling
     - What checks happen
     - What errors are thrown
     - How failures are handled

=> What is an API?
   API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two software systems to communicate with each other. An API 
   defines how you can ask for data or send data to another system, and what response you will get.

   Real-life analogy
   - You (client) → place an order
   - Waiter (API) → takes request
   - Kitchen (server/database) → prepares food
   - Waiter → brings response

   In software terms
   - Frontend / mobile app → sends request
   - Backend API → processes request
   - Database → stores/retrieves data
   - API → sends response back

=> Why APIs are used
   APIs are used to:
   - Connect frontend and backend
   - Share data between services
   - Hide internal logic
   - Enforce security
   - Enable scalability

=> What is a REST API(Representational State Transfer)?
   REST API is a type of API that follows specific rules called REST principles. A REST API uses HTTP methods and URLs 
   in a standardized way to perform operations on data.

   HTTP methods in REST:
   - GET	        Read data
   - POST	        Create data
   - PUT / PATCH	Update data
   - DELETE	        Delete data
