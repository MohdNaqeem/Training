=> What is CDN (Content Delivery Network) ?
   A CDN is a network of servers placed around the world that deliver files (CSS, JS, images, videos) to users faster by serving them 
   from the nearest server location.

=> Why CDN exists ?
   - Without CDN:
     Everything loads from one server → slow if users are far away.

   - With CDN:
     Files load from a nearby server → faster, lower latency, better performance.

=> What is crossorigin ?
   crossorigin is an attribute that tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when loading a script from 
   another domain.

=> first hello world program in reach :
   let heading2 = React.createElement("h1", {id:"showHeading"}, "Hello world from React!")
   let data = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("rootData"))
   data.render(heading2)
   
   - React.createElement 
     It's creat object and this react object becomes html that browser understands. and It takes three argument.
     01 which tag we want to create.
     02 object, and in this object we can pass attributes.
     03 what Content we want to print in created tag.

   - ReactDOM.createRoot
     This tells React to create a React root on that HTML element.

   - document.getElementById("rootData")
     This finds the HTML element with id rootData.

   - data.render(heading2)
     render() tells React what we want to show inside the root.
