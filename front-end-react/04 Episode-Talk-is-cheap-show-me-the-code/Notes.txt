# Episode 01 

=> What is CDN (Content Delivery Network) ?
   A CDN is a network of servers placed around the world that deliver files (CSS, JS, images, videos) to users faster by serving them 
   from the nearest server location.

=> Why CDN exists ?
   - Without CDN:
     Everything loads from one server → slow if users are far away.

   - With CDN:
     Files load from a nearby server → faster, lower latency, better performance.

=> What is crossorigin ?
   crossorigin is an attribute that tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when loading a script from 
   another domain.

=> first hello world program in reach :
   let heading2 = React.createElement("h1", {id:"showHeading"}, "Hello world from React!")
   let data = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("rootData"))
   data.render(heading2)
   
   - React.createElement 
     It's creat object and this react object becomes html that browser understands. and It takes three argument.
     01 which tag we want to create.
     02 object, and in this object we can pass attributes.
     03 what Content we want to print in created tag.

   - ReactDOM.createRoot
     This tells React to create a React root on that HTML element.

   - document.getElementById("rootData")
     This finds the HTML element with id rootData.

   - data.render(heading2)
     render() tells React what we want to show inside the root.

=> What is a Library? 
   A library is a collection of reusable functions and tools that you call whenever we need them. We control the flow.

   Example : React is a library because we decide.
   - when to render
   - what to render
   - how to structure your app

=> What is a Framework?
   A framework is a complete structure or architecture for building an application. The framework controls the flow we just fill 
   in the missing parts.

=> Difference between Library and framework.:
   A library gives you tools to use when you want, while a framework gives you the entire structure and controls how your application 
   should run.

# Episode 02

=> What is npm ?
   NPM is a tool that allows us to download, install, manage, and update JavaScript packages (libraries, tools, frameworks).

=> what is package.json?
   package.json is the main configuration file for any Node.js or JavaScript project. It stores all the project information, 
   settings, and the list of dependencies (libraries) the project needs.

=> What are dependencies in package.json?
   dependencies are the main packages your project needs to run in production. These are required for your app to work normally 
   both during development and after deployment.

   Type of dependencies:
   01 dependencies:
      These are the real, required, production dependencies.

   02 devDependencies:
      These are packages used only during development not needed in production.

=> what is Caret ^ ?
   updates automatically minor versions

=> what is Tilde ~?
   updates automatically major versions 

=> What is package-lock.json?
   It locks the exact versions of every dependency

=> What is node_modules?
   This is the actual folder containing every installed package your project uses.  

   - what is parcel doing :
     It’s creates dev build for us
     It’s creates local server for us
     It’s automatically refresh the browser (its giving HMR)
     It’s watches algorithms.
     It’s faster builds 
     It’s bundling.
     It’s give good error handling.
     Tree shaking. (It’s remove unused code)

=> What is parcel ?
   It’s a tool that builds our project by taking all our files and turning them into optimized output for the browser.

=> What is npx ?
   npx is a command that runs packages without installing them globally.

# Episode 03

=> What is JSX ?
   JSX is a cleaner way to write React elements instead of using React.createElement.

   - Key points you must know (interview level)
     - JSX is not HTML : It’s just a syntax extension for JavaScript.
     - JSX must be compiled : Babel converts JSX → JS because browsers can’t read JSX. So Babel converts JSX → React.createElement().
     - JSX prevents injection attacks : React escapes everything by default.
     - JSX expressions must return one parent element
     - JSX allows JS inside {} : <h1>{2 + 2}</h1>
     - JSX should be in round brackets because babel needs to understand from where is JSX starting and where is ending.
   
=> What JSX Really Is?
   SX is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows you to write UI using HTML-like code, and embed anything inside it — components, 
   variables, expressions, function calls, arrays, and even other JSX elements — because JSX ultimately compiles into normal 
   JavaScript.

=> What is babel ?
   Babel is a compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) and JSX into older JavaScript that browsers actually understand.

   - Why do we need Babel?
     - Browsers don’t support all modern JS features.
     - Browsers cannot understand JSX at all.
     - We want consistent code behavior across old and new browsers.

=> What is a Component in React?
   A component in React is an independent, reusable unit of UI that behaves like a JavaScript function. It accepts input 
   (props) and returns React elements that describe what should appear on the screen.

=> Types of Components in React
   React has two official types of components: Functional Components (Modern React) and Class Components (Legacy React).
   And They are patterns, not different component types.

   - Functional Components (Modern React)
     A functional component is a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. It uses React Hooks to manage state, side effects, 
     and lifecycle behavior. Modern React uses Functional components.
   
   - Class Components (Legacy React)
     A class component is an ES6 class that extends React.Component and uses the render() method to return JSX.
     It manages state and lifecycle through class methods.

=> What is composition component?
   Component composition is the technique of building complex UIs by combining multiple smaller, reusable components together.

=> What is React element?
   A React Element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to show on the screen. It is the smallest building 
   block in React and is created using JSX or React.createElement().

# Episode 04

=> What is props?
   Props (properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow down the 
   component tree and make components reusable and dynamic.
   When we have to dynamically pass some data to a component we pass it as a props.

=> What is Conflict-Driven UI?
   Conflict-driven UI is a pattern where the UI updates itself based on the differences (conflicts) between the old virtual UI and 
   the new virtual UI. React compares both and updates only the changed parts automatically.

=> What is a key?
   A key is a unique identifier that React uses to track each item in a list when rendering arrays.

   - What you MUST NOT use as keys
     React documentation and experienced developers agree: never use index for key.
     - Breaks when list changes order
     - Breaks when items deleted
     - Breaks when items inserted
     - Causes React to reuse wrong components
