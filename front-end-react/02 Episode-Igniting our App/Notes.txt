# Episode 01 

=> What is CDN (Content Delivery Network) ?
   A CDN is a network of servers placed around the world that deliver files (CSS, JS, images, videos) to users faster by serving them 
   from the nearest server location.

=> Why CDN exists ?
   - Without CDN:
     Everything loads from one server → slow if users are far away.

   - With CDN:
     Files load from a nearby server → faster, lower latency, better performance.

=> What is crossorigin ?
   crossorigin is an attribute that tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when loading a script from 
   another domain.

=> first hello world program in reach :
   let heading2 = React.createElement("h1", {id:"showHeading"}, "Hello world from React!")
   let data = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("rootData"))
   data.render(heading2)
   
   - React.createElement 
     It's creat object and this react object becomes html that browser understands. and It takes three argument.
     01 which tag we want to create.
     02 object, and in this object we can pass attributes.
     03 what Content we want to print in created tag.

   - ReactDOM.createRoot
     This tells React to create a React root on that HTML element.

   - document.getElementById("rootData")
     This finds the HTML element with id rootData.

   - data.render(heading2)
     render() tells React what we want to show inside the root.

=> What is a Library? 
   A library is a collection of reusable functions and tools that you call whenever we need them. We control the flow.

   Example : React is a library because we decide.
   - when to render
   - what to render
   - how to structure your app

=> What is a Framework?
   A framework is a complete structure or architecture for building an application. The framework controls the flow we just fill 
   in the missing parts.

=> Difference between Library and framework.:
   A library gives you tools to use when you want, while a framework gives you the entire structure and controls how your application 
   should run.

# Episode 02

=> What is npm ?
   NPM is a tool that allows us to download, install, manage, and update JavaScript packages (libraries, tools, frameworks).

=> what is package.json?
   package.json is the main configuration file for any Node.js or JavaScript project. It stores all the project information, 
   settings, and the list of dependencies (libraries) the project needs.

=> What are dependencies in package.json?
   dependencies are the main packages your project needs to run in production. These are required for your app to work normally 
   both during development and after deployment.

   Type of dependencies:
   01 dependencies:
      These are the real, required, production dependencies.

   02 devDependencies:
      These are packages used only during development not needed in production.

=> what is Caret ^ ?
   updates automatically minor versions

=> what is Tilde ~?
   updates automatically major versions 

=> What is package-lock.json?
   It locks the exact versions of every dependency

=> What is node_modules?
   This is the actual folder containing every installed package your project uses.  

=> What is parcel ?
   It’s a tool that builds our project by taking all our files and turning them into optimized output for the browser.
