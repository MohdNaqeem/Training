# Episode 01 

=> What is React?
   React is a JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive user interfaces. It focuses only on the view layer (UI) and helps you 
   build applications using components. React was created by Facebook to solve the performance issues of large web apps.

=> Why React is Fast?
   React isn’t magically fast. It uses specific techniques that reduce unnecessary work in the browser.

   # Virtual DOM:
     - The browser DOM is slow.
     - Instead of updating the real DOM every time, React creates a lightweight virtual copy.
     * When something changes:
       - React compares old Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM (diffing).
       - Then React updates only the exact part of the real DOM that changed.

   # Component-Based Architecture:
     UI is broken into small independent pieces (components). Only the component with changed state re-renders, not the entire page.

   # Lazy Loading + Code Splitting
     React loads only the JS needed at the moment. This reduces initial load time drastically.

   # React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive UIs using a component-based approach. It uses a Virtual DOM, 
     efficient diffing, and unidirectional data flow to minimize real DOM updates. This makes React highly performant, predictable, 
     and suitable for large-scale applications.

=> Why React is good?
   React is good because it solves the biggest problems in modern frontend development: speed, scalability, reusability, and efficient 
   UI rendering. It gives developers a predictable way to build complex UI without the app turning into unmaintainable spaghetti.

=> What is CDN (Content Delivery Network) ?
   A CDN is a network of servers placed around the world that deliver files (CSS, JS, images, videos) to users faster by serving them 
   from the nearest server location.

=> Why CDN exists ?
   - Without CDN:
     Everything loads from one server → slow if users are far away.

   - With CDN:
     Files load from a nearby server → faster, lower latency, better performance.

=> What is crossorigin ?
   crossorigin is an attribute that tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) when loading a script from 
   another domain.

=> first hello world program in reach :
   let heading2 = React.createElement("h1", {id:"showHeading"}, "Hello world from React!")
   let data = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("rootData"))
   data.render(heading2)
   
   - React.createElement 
     It's creat object and this react object becomes html that browser understands. and It takes three argument.
     01 which tag we want to create.
     02 object, and in this object we can pass attributes.
     03 what Content we want to print in created tag.

   - ReactDOM.createRoot
     This tells React to create a React root on that HTML element.

   - document.getElementById("rootData")
     This finds the HTML element with id rootData.

   - data.render(heading2)
     render() tells React what we want to show inside the root.

=> What is a Library? 
   A library is a collection of reusable functions and tools that you call whenever we need them. We control the flow.

   Example : React is a library because we decide.
   - when to render
   - what to render
   - how to structure your app

=> What is a Framework?
   A framework is a complete structure or architecture for building an application. The framework controls the flow we just fill 
   in the missing parts.

=> Difference between Library and framework.:
   A library gives you tools to use when you want, while a framework gives you the entire structure and controls how your application 
   should run.

# Episode 02

=> What is npm ?
   NPM is a tool that allows us to download, install, manage, and update JavaScript packages (libraries, tools, frameworks).

=> what is package.json?
   package.json is the main configuration file for any Node.js or JavaScript project. It stores all the project information, 
   settings, and the list of dependencies (libraries) the project needs.

=> What are dependencies in package.json?
   dependencies are the main packages your project needs to run in production. These are required for your app to work normally 
   both during development and after deployment.

   Type of dependencies:
   01 dependencies:
      These are the real, required, production dependencies.

   02 devDependencies:
      These are packages used only during development not needed in production.

=> what is Caret ^ ?
   updates automatically minor versions

=> what is Tilde ~?
   updates automatically major versions 

=> What is package-lock.json?
   It locks the exact versions of every dependency

=> What is node_modules?
   This is the actual folder containing every installed package your project uses.  

   - what is parcel doing :
     It’s creates dev build for us
     It’s creates local server for us
     It’s automatically refresh the browser (its giving HMR)
     It’s watches algorithms.
     It’s faster builds 
     It’s bundling.
     It’s give good error handling.
     Tree shaking. (It’s remove unused code)

=> What is parcel ?
   It’s a tool that builds our project by taking all our files and turning them into optimized output for the browser.

=> What is npx ?
   npx is a command that runs packages without installing them globally.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Episode 03

=> What is JSX ?
   JSX is a cleaner way to write React elements instead of using React.createElement.

   - Key points you must know (interview level)
     - JSX is not HTML : It’s just a syntax extension for JavaScript.
     - JSX must be compiled : Babel converts JSX → JS because browsers can’t read JSX. So Babel converts JSX → React.createElement().
     - JSX prevents injection attacks : React escapes everything by default.
     - JSX expressions must return one parent element
     - JSX allows JS inside {} : <h1>{2 + 2}</h1>
     - JSX should be in round brackets because babel needs to understand from where is JSX starting and where is ending.
   
=> What JSX Really Is?
   SX is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows you to write UI using HTML-like code, and embed anything inside it — components, 
   variables, expressions, function calls, arrays, and even other JSX elements — because JSX ultimately compiles into normal 
   JavaScript.

=> What is babel ?
   Babel is a compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) and JSX into older JavaScript that browsers actually understand.

   - Why do we need Babel?
     - Browsers don’t support all modern JS features.
     - Browsers cannot understand JSX at all.
     - We want consistent code behavior across old and new browsers.

=> What is a Component in React?
   A component in React is an independent, reusable unit of UI that behaves like a JavaScript function. It accepts input 
   (props) and returns React elements that describe what should appear on the screen.

=> Types of Components in React
   React has two official types of components: Functional Components (Modern React) and Class Components (Legacy React).
   And They are patterns, not different component types.

   - Functional Components (Modern React)
     A functional component is a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. It uses React Hooks to manage state, side effects, 
     and lifecycle behavior. Modern React uses Functional components.
   
   - Class Components (Legacy React)
     A class component is an ES6 class that extends React.Component and uses the render() method to return JSX.
     It manages state and lifecycle through class methods.

=> What is composition component?
   Component composition is the technique of building complex UIs by combining multiple smaller, reusable components together.

=> What is React element?
   A React Element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to show on the screen. It is the smallest building 
   block in React and is created using JSX or React.createElement().
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Episode 04

=> What is props?
   Props (properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow down the 
   component tree and make components reusable and dynamic.
   When we have to dynamically pass some data to a component we pass it as a props.

=> What is Conflict-Driven UI?
   Conflict-driven UI is a pattern where the UI updates itself based on the differences (conflicts) between the old virtual UI and 
   the new virtual UI. React compares both and updates only the changed parts automatically.

=> What is a key?
   A key is a unique identifier that React uses to track each item in a list when rendering arrays.

   - What you MUST NOT use as keys
     React documentation and experienced developers agree: never use index for key.
     - Breaks when list changes order
     - Breaks when items deleted
     - Breaks when items inserted
     - Causes React to reuse wrong components
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Episode 05 

=> What is component?
   A React component is a reusable piece of UI that returns JSX and can be composed to build the entire application. React has two 
   main component types.

   # Functional Components
     A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. It is lightweight, easy to write, and the modern standard.
     - Clean & simple
     - Use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
     - Easier to test
     - Better performance

   # Class Components
     A class component is a JS class that extends React.Component, and must use a render() method to return JSX.
     - Old method of building components
     - Use lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.)
     - More code + more complex
     - Still asked in interviews 

=> What is import and export?
   They are ES Module features used to share code between files. React uses ES Modules to break your app into components, functions, 
   variables, and classes across separate files — making your project modular. It has two types

   # Named Export:
     Named export is used when you want to export many variables, functions, or components from the same file. Import name must match 
     the exported name.
     - Must use {} while importing
     - Names must match exactly.

   # Default Export:
     Default export is used when your file returns one main value/component. Import does not need {} and name can be changed.
     - No {} required.
     - Import name can be whatever you choose.
     - One default export per file.

   # Tips:
     we can use named exports along with a default export in the same file. React/JavaScript fully supports mixing both it's common 
     in real projects.

=> What Are Hooks in React?
   Hooks are functions that let you use React features like state, lifecycle methods, context, and performance optimization inside 
   functional components.

   # Common Hooks:
     - useState → state management
     - useEffect → side effects
     - useContext → global data
     - useReducer → complex state
     - useMemo → performance
     - useCallback → memoized functions
     - useRef → DOM access, persistent values

=> What is useState()?
   useState is a Hook that lets you define a state variable and a function to update that variable. React re-renders the component 
   whenever the state update function is called.

=> What is a State Variable?
   A state variable holds dynamic data in React. Whenever it changes, React re-renders the component to keep the UI in sync with the 
   latest state 

=> What is useEffect()?
   useEffect is used to run code when the component renders, when specific state values change, or when the component unmounts. It 
   manages side effects such as API calls, timers, subscriptions, and event listeners.
   useEffect takes two arguments: a callback function and a dependency array. React runs the callback after the component renders, 
   and the dependency array controls when that callback should run again.

=> How dependency array controls when useEffect runs
   - useEffect(() => {}, [])
     Runs only once → after initial render
   - useEffect(() => {})
     Runs after every render
   - useEffect(() => {}, [value])
     Runs every time value changes

=> What is the Virtual DOM?
   Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses this virtual copy to track changes and update 
   only the specific parts of the real DOM that actually changed — not the entire UI.

=> How Virtual DOM Works
   - React Component Changes State:
     Whenever state or props change, React doesn’t update the real DOM immediately.
   - React Creates a NEW Virtual DOM Tree:
     React builds a new virtual snapshot of the UI.
   - React Compares it with the OLD Virtual DOM
     This is called the Diffing Algorithm. It checks, What changed?, Which element?, Which attribute/text/style was modified?
   - React Finds the Minimum Required Changes:
     React calculates the smallest possible update to move the old DOM → new DOM.
   - React Updates Only the Required Real DOM Nodes
     This is done through: Reconciliation

=> Why React Uses Virtual DOM?
   - Browser DOM is slow to update.
   - Re-rendering entire UI is expensive.
   - Updating only the changed elements is fast.

# Episode 06

=> What is Monolith architecture?
   A monolithic architecture is a software design where the frontend, backend, and all application logic are built, managed, and 
   deployed as a single unified application, instead of being divided into independent services or modules.

=> What is Microservices architecture?
   Microservices architecture is a design where the application is split into multiple small, independent services, each deployed and 
   scaled separately.

=> how webApp and UI application fetch the data from backend?
   There are two approach.

   01 Load → Fetch API → Render
      - Sequence:
        - Page loads
        - UI waits for API response
        - Once data arrives, UI renders the final content
 
   02 Load → Render UI → Fetch API → Re-render
      - Sequence:
        - Page loads
        - UI renders immediately (empty state, loader, skeleton)
        - API call happens in the background
        - UI re-renders when data arrives

=> What is useState?
   useState is a React Hook that lets a functional component create and manage its own state. It stores a value, and provides a 
   function to update that value so React can re-render the component whenever the state changes.

   - What is it used for?
     You use useEffect when your component needs to do something like:
     - Fetch data from backend
     - Run code only when the component mounts
     - Run code when state/props change
     - Clean up things when component unmounts

=> What is Shimmer UI?
   Shimmer UI is a loading placeholder technique where grey placeholder shapes are displayed with a moving light-gradient animation to 
   indicate that real content is loading.

=> What is conditional rendering?
   Conditional rendering is the process of deciding which UI elements to display based on conditions such as state, props, or logic, 
   instead of always showing everything.

=> why we use state variable not local variable?
   We use state variables instead of local variables because state persists between renders and updates the UI when changed, while 
   local variables reset on every render and cannot update the UI.
