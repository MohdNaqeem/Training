=> There are three syntax of binding 
   Interpolation
   Property binding
   Event binding

=> What is interpolation and binding.
   In AngularJS, Interpolation is a way to transfer the data from a TypeScript code to an HTML template 
   (view), i.e. it is a method by which we can put an expression in between some text and get the value 
   of that expression. Interpolation basically binds the text with the expression value. 
   interpolation just work in the case of number, numeric value and string it doesn't work in the 
   case of boolean.
   Syntax : propertyName={{VariableandFuntionName}} , {{VariableandFuntionName}}

=> What is property binding
   Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Use 
   property binding to do things such as toggle button features, set paths programmatically, and share 
   values between components.
   where we have to change the value of data and disabled then in this case we have to use property binding
   Sntax : [propertyName]=VariableandFunctionName

=> What is event binding
   Event binding lets you listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, 
   clicks, and touches. See the live example / download example for a working example containing the code 
   snippets in this guide.

=> What is directives.
   In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new behavior to the elements in the 
   template or modify existing behavior. The purpose of Directives in Angular is to maneuver the DOM, be 
   it by adding new elements to DOM or removing elements and even changing the appearance of the DOM 
   elements. there are two types structural and attribute directives.

=> What is structural directives.
   Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. Angular provides a set of built-in structural directives (such as NgIf , NgForOf , NgSwitch and others) which are commonly used in all Angular projects. For more information see Built-in directives.

=> What is Attribute directives.
   Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

=> Built Directives
   *ngIf
   *ngFor
   *ngSwitch  
   *ngClass
   *ngStyle

=> ngIf
   The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}. If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.

=> ngFor
   ngFor is a structural directive used for rendering a set of elements or repeating a template for each item in a collection. The ngFor directive is commonly used to iterate over arrays or lists and generate HTML elements dynamically based on the data in the collection.

=> ngSwitch
   The ngSwitch directive is used for conditional rendering in Angular templates, providing a way to switch between multiple cases based on the value of an expression.

=> ngClass
   The ng-class directive dynamically binds one or more CSS classes to an HTML element. The value of the ng-class directive can be a string, an object, or an array. If it is a string, it should contain one or more, space-separated class names.

=> ngstyle
   The ng-style directive specifies the style attribute for the HTML element. The value of the ng-style attribute must be an object, or an expression returning an object. The object consists of CSS properties and values, in key value pairs.
