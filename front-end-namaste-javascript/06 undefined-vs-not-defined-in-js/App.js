/*
Notes :

- Undefined is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory 
  creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed JS engine assigns undefined to the 
  variables.

- Not Defined means if we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code 
  then we get Not Defined error.

- JS is a loosely typed language or weakly typed language means it does not attaches its variables 
  to specific data types.

- Most impoertant this undefined !== not defined 
  undefined mean which is declared but value is not read and not defined mean which is not 
  decalred.
