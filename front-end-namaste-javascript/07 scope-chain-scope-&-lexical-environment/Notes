=> What is scope?
   Scope mean where we can access a specific variable and function in our code that is scope. javascript has
   main types of scope.
   
   Global Scope:
   Variables declared outside of any function, or declared with the var keyword at the top level of a script, 
   have global scope. Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere within the script, including 
   inside functions.

   Local Scope:
   Variables declared inside a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function.
   Each function creates its own scope, and variables declared within it are not visible outside of that 
   function.
