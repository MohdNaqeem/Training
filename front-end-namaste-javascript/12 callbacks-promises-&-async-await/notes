=> What is synchronous?
   synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each 
   instruction waits for the provious instruction to complete the execution.

=> What is asynchronous?
   Due to synchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous 
   instructions which cause delay in the UI. asynchronous code execution allows to execute next 
   instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.

=> What is callback function?
   a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed   after the completion of some operation. The primary purpose of a callback is to specify what should   happen after a particular asynchronous task or operation is completed.
