=> What is synchronous?
   synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the provious instruction to complete the execution.

=> What is asynchronous?
   Due to synchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions which cause delay in the UI. asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.

=> What is callback function?
   a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed  after the completion of some operation. The primary purpose of a callback is to specify what should  happen after a particular asynchronous task or operation is completed.

=> What is callbeck hell?
   Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another Callback. It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. If you look at the design of the code, it seems just like a pyramid. 

=> What is promise?
   Promise in javascript for eventual completion of task. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations more easily and avoid callback hell. Promise ia a object which has 3 states pending, fullfiled(resolve), rejected. resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JS itself.

   A javascript promise object can be.
   - Pending : the result is undefined.
   - Resolved : the result is fulfilled.
   - Rejected : the result is an error object.
   
   In JavaScript promises, then and catch are methods used to handle the result (fulfillment) or failure (rejection) of a promise respectively.
   - then method is used to handle the successful fulfillment of a promise.
   - catch method is used to handle the failure (rejection) of a promise.

=> async await?
   Async/await is a modern JavaScript feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style using async functions and the await keyword.
