        What is set object ? 
        A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values. Each value can only store once in a 
        Set. A Set can hold any value of any data type. whether primitive values or object references.

        Explanation : 

        in this logic we have created one array which is hold multiple value including duplicates 
        value and we had to remove duplicate character using set object.

        then we have created one more variable and inside this variable we are using set method 
        which is introduced in Ecmascript 6 the purpose of set obejct is it's store only unique 
        value it's remove all the duplicate charater.

        (...) this triple dot basically we called this spread operators.
        The spread operator (...) is used to convert the Set back into an array.
        const result = [...new Set(arrDuplicate)] creates a new array named unique containing 
        the unique elements from the original array.
