        Notes
        
        What is set object ? 
        A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values. Each value can only store once in a Set.A Set 
        can hold any value of any data type. whether primitive values or object references.

        Explanation : 

        in this logic we have created one array which is hold multiple value including duplicates value 
        and we had to remove duplicate character using set object.

        then we have created one more variable and inside this variable we are using set method which is
        introduced in Ecmascript 6 the purpose of set obejct is it's store only unique value it's remove
        all the duplicate charater.

        (...) this triple dot basically we called this spread operators.
        The spread operator (...) is used to convert the Set back into an array.
        const result = [...new Set(arrDuplicate)] creates a new array named unique containing the unique 
        elements from the original array.
