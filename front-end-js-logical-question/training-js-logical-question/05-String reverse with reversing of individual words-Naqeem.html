    Notes :

    - split()
      The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings.
      The split() method returns the new array.
      The split() method does not change the original string.
      If (" ") is used as separator, the string is split between words.
      If ("") is used as separator, the string is split between each word.
    
    - reverse()
      The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array.
      The reverse() method overwrites the original array.

    - join()  
      The join() method returns an array as a string.
      The join() method does not change the original array.
      Any separator can be specified. The default is comma (,).

    Explanation : 

    In this logic we had to reverse string with reversing of individual words.

    first we have created funtction and inside function we have variable and inside this variable we
    have string and we had to reverse string with reversing of individual words.
    
    So, inside function we have created one more variable to put the result. and inside this variable
    we use split method to convert string into an array. we are just using ('') not space so it will
    split each word into an array. 

    then we used reverse method which is reverse string into an array. after this we used join method
    to join reversed array of string.
