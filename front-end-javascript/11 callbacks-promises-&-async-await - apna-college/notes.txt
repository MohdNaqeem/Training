=> What is synchronous?
   Synchronous means code runs step-by-step, in order. Each instruction waits for the previous one to finish before moving 
   ahead. Because JavaScript is single-threaded, synchronous code can block the flow if one task takes too long.

=> What is asynchronous?
   Asynchronous means JavaScript can start a task and move on without waiting for it to finish. The task completes in the 
   background, and the result is handled later.

=> What is callback function?
   A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it is executed after a certain task 
   completes. Callbacks are used especially for asynchronous operations like timers, network calls, etc.

=> What is callbeck hell?
   Callback Hell is when too many nested callbacks appear inside each other, forming a pyramid-like structure that is hard 
   to read, debug, and maintain.

=> What is promise?
   Promises give us a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. It helps avoid callback hell and 
   provides a cleaner way to handle async tasks.

   A Promise has three states:
   - Pending : operation is not finished
   - Resolved : operation completed successfully
   - Rejected : operation failed

   To handle the result:
   - .then() → handles success
   - .finally() → runs regardless of success or failure
   - .catch() → handles errors

=> async await?
   Async/await is a modern JavaScript feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style using async 
   functions and the await keyword. This makes code much easier to read and write.
   - async makes a function return a Promise
   - await pauses the function until a Promise settles
