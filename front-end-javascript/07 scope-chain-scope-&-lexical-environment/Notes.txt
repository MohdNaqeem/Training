=> What is scope?
   Scope defines where a variable or function can be accessed in your code. JavaScript has two main types of scope:
   
   # Global Scope:
     - Variables declared outside any function are global.
     - They can be accessed from anywhere, even inside functions.

   # Local Scope:
     - Variables declared inside a function are local.
     - They are only accessible within that function and not outside it.

=> what is lexical scope?
   If a child function is inside a parent function, the child can always access the parent's variables this is lexical scope.

=> what is Scope Chain?
   When JavaScript tries to access a variable:
   - It looks inside the current function scope.
   - If not found, it looks into the parent scope.
   - If not found, it checks the next parent, continuing until the global scope.
   - If still not found → ReferenceError.
   This linked structure is called the scope chain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Example of lexical scope:
   # Example 01: let declared in parent → child CAN access it.

   function parent() {
   let x = 50;
   function child() {
   console.log(x);  //  child can access x
   }
   child();
   }
   parent();

   Explanation:
   Because the child is inside the parent, so the child function gets access to the parent’s variables no matter if it's 
   let or var. Lexical scope doesn’t care about var/let/const.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # Example 02: let declared in global → parent & child CAN access it.

   let x = 100;
   function parent() {
   function child() {
   console.log(x);  //  works
   }
   child();
   }
   parent();

   Explanation:
   Because global is the parent of all functions. So child → parent → global.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # Example 03: let declared INSIDE child → parent CANNOT access it

   function parent() {
   function child() {
   let x = 20;
   }
   console.log(x);  //  Error: x is not defined
   child();
   }
   parent();

   Explanation:
   Because parent is outside the child. Lexical scope only allows the child to see the parent's variables, not the other way 
   around.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # Example 04: If you try to use let before it is declared
   
   console.log(a);  //  ReferenceError
   let a = 10;

   Explanation:
   Because let is hoisted but not initialized, so it stays in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
