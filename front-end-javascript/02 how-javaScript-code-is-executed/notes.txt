=> JavaScript is a single-threaded language, so it has one call stack and executes one command at a time.

  # When JavaScript code runs, it first creates a Global Execution Context. An execution context has two parts: 

  01 Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase): so in memory creattion phase
    - JavaScript scans the code for variable and function declarations.
    - It allocates memory for variables and function declarations.
    - Variables are initialized with undefined (hoisting).
    - let/const are hoisted but left uninitialized,
    - Functions are stored with their entire function body.

  02 Code Execution Phase: 
    - JavaScript executes code line by line using the call stack.
    - When a value is assigned, undefined is replaced with the actual value.
    - When a function is called, JavaScript creates a new Execution Context for that function.
    - This new context goes on top of the call stack, runs through the same two phases, and is removed after execution.
