=> Function :
   Functions is a block of code that performs a specific task, it can be invoked(call) whenever needed.

   - parameters

     Parameters are placeholders inside the function. They don’t have real values until the function is called.

     values we pass into the function, that is parameters. values like a local variable, it has block scope and can be access only 
     inside function.

   - arguments 
     Arguments are the actual values we pass into the function when calling it.

   - return
     The return keyword sends a value back from the function to wherever it was called.

=> Example :

    function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
        let total = price * quantity;
         return total;   
    }
    
=> forEach :
   forEach executes a given function once for every element in the array in order.
   forEach is NOT a loop by itself. It is a function (a method) that runs a callback function on every element of an array.

   - Basic Syntax
    
        array.forEach(function(element, index, array) {
               // code
       });
   
   - Parameters of the callback function
     element → current value

     index (optional) → position of the element

     array (optional) → the original array
