=> what is currying?
   Currying is a technique where a function doesn’t take all arguments at once. Instead, it takes one argument at a time and 
   returns a new function for the next argument, until all arguments are received.

   # Explanation:
     - It transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into nested functions taking one argument each.
     - It uses closures to remember previous arguments.
     - Improves code reusability and modularity.
