=> What is block?
   A block is a piece of code written inside { }. JavaScript uses blocks to group multiple statements together so they can 
   be treated as one unit

=> What is scope of variable pr function?
   Scope is the region of code where a variable or function can be accessed. Different declarations (var, let, const) have 
   different scope rules.

=> what is block scope?
   Block scope means that variables declared with let or const inside a block { } are only accessible inside that block, 
   not outside it.

=> What is shadowing?
   Shadowing happens when a child block creates a new variable with the same name as a variable in the parent scope. The inner
   variable temporarily hides the outer one inside that block.

=> Why let and const are block scope?
   Because every { } block creates its own separate area (lexical environment) for let and const. So they exist only inside 
   that block and cannot be accessed outside.
