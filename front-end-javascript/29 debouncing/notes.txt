=> What is debouncing?
   Debouncing ensures a function executes only after the user stops triggering it for a specified delay. It’s used to reduce 
   cunnecessary function calls—especially in typing, scrolling, and resize events.

   # Why Debouncing Exists:
     - typing in a search bar (keyup fires every letter)
     - resizing window
     - scrolling
     - button spam clicks
     Running logic on every event is slow and wasteful. Debouncing fixes that by delaying execution until things settle down.
