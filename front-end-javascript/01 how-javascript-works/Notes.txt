=> How JavaScript works?
   Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

=> Execution context has two component
   1 - memory component[variable environment] 
   This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

   2 - code component[Thread of execution]
   This is the place where code is executed one line at a time using call Stack.

   # JavaScript itself is a single-threaded, synchronous language, meaning
    It has one call stack and It can run one instruction at a time.

   # However, modern environments (browsers/Node) provide asynchronous behavior through:
     - Web APIs
     - Event Loop
     - callback

=> What is callback and microtask queue?
   Callback queue stores asynchronous tasks like setTimeout or DOM events. Microtask queue stores higher-priority tasks like Promise 
   callbacks, and it always runs before the callback queue.
