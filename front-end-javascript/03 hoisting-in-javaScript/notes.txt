=> What is hoisting ?
   Hoisting is a process where all variable and function declarations move top of the table before execution starts

   var variables are hoisted and initialized with undefined, function declarations are hoisted with their full function body, 
   while let and const are hoisted but not initialized and remain in the Temporal Dead Zone until their actual declaration 
   executes.

   Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables and cannot be accessed before initialization.

   Because of hoisting, we sometimes get undefined for var, errors for let/const, and full access for function declarations.

=> Behavior of var, let, const, functions, and arrow functions

   # var Hoisted + initialized with undefined
       Example:
       console.log(x);  // undefined
       var x = 3;
     JavaScript internally treats it like:
       var x;          // hoisted
       console.log(x); // undefined
       x = 3;          // assignment

   # let and const – Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ)
       Example:
       console.log(a);  // ReferenceError
       let a = 10;
     Because the variable exists in memory but is not yet initialized, this period is called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). 

   # Function Declarations – Fully Hoisted
       Example:
       hello();   // Works
       function hello() {
       console.log("Hi");
       }
     The entire function is stored in memory during the memory phase, so it can be invoked before reaching its line in the 
     code.

   # Function Expressions / Arrow Functions – NOT hoisted like functions
     They behave like variables, not like function declarations.
