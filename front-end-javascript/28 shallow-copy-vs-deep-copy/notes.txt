=> What is shallow copy?
   A shallow copy creates a new object or array, but only copies the top-level values. If the original contains nested objects/arrays, 
   the copy will still point to the same inner reference. So changes inside nested objects affect both copies.

   # For primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined):
     - Shallow copy makes a new copy of the value.
     - So changing it will NOT affect the original.
     - Example: in App.js example number 1

   # For non-primitive types (object,array,function)
     - only the reference will copy 
     - not inner data 
     - Example: in App.js example number 2

=> What is deep copy ?
   Creating a new object where every level (top + nested) is copied, with new memory references, so changes in one object do not affect 
   the other.

   # Methods:
     - structuredClone(obj) → best modern
     - JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) → simple objects only

=> Difference between shallow copy and deep copy.
   Shallow copy in nested objects case will modify the parent object property value, if cloned object property value is changed. 
   But deep copy will not modify the parent object property value.
