=> What is this keyword? 
   this is a reference to the object that is executing the current function.

   # Example :
     - If a function is called inside an object, this refers to that object.
     - If a function is called normally, this refers to global object (in browser: window).
     - In arrow functions, this does NOT point to the object — it takes value from the outer lexical scope and for Regular 
       functions bind dynamically.
