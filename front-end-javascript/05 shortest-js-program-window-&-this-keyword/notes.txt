=> The shortest JavaScript program is an empty file. Even with no code, the browser still creates:
   - a Global Execution Context, and
   - the global object, which is window in browsers.
  
- Global space means any code that is not written inside a function.
  variables and functions are stored in the global scope and become properties of the global object

  Anything you write outside a function becomes global; anything inside a function stays local and is not part of the global 
  space
