=> Are let and const hoisted?
   let and const are hoisted, but they are not initialized during hoisting. They stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until 
   execution reaches their declaration..
   var is also hoisted but initialized to undefined, so it can be accessed early.

=> Difference between var, let, and const
   # Hoisting & Initialization
     - var → hoisted + initialized to undefined
     - let / const → hoisted but not initialized (TDZ)

   # Redeclaration
     - var → can redeclare
     - let → cannot redeclare
     - const → cannot redeclare

   # Reassignment
     - var → can reassign
     - let → can reassign
     - const → cannot reassign

   # Scope
     - var → function-scoped
     - let / const → block-scoped

=> Error Types in JavaScript
   # SyntaxError
     Thrown when the code is written incorrectly.
     Example: missing brackets, invalid tokens.

   # ReferenceError
     Thrown when accessing a variable that is not declared or in TDZ.

   # TypeError
     Thrown when performing an invalid operation on a value.
