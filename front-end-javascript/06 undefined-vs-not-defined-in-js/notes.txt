=> undefined:
  - undefined is a special value assigned by the JavaScript engine during the Memory Creation Phase.
  - When a variable is declared but not assigned, JavaScript gives it the value undefined. it means The variable exists in 
    memory, but no value was assigned yet.

=> not defined:
  - means the variable doesn’t exist in memory at all.

JavaScript is loosely/weakly typed, meaning variables do not have fixed types, and they can hold any data type.
which is why undefined is used as a placeholder.
