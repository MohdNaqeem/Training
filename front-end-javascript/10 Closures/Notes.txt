=> what is closure?
   A closure is formed when an inner (child) function remembers and can access variables from its outer (parent) function, 
   even after the parent function has finished executing.

=> Why does this happen?
   Because JavaScript uses lexical scope, the child function is created inside the parent.So it gets a link to the parent’s 
   variables.
   When the parent function returns, JavaScript does not delete the parent’s variables if the child function is still 
   using them. This preserved memory is called a closure.

   # Simple Parent–Child Example:
   
   function parent() {
   let count = 0;
   function child() {
   console.log(count);
   }
   return child;
   }
   const fn = parent();
   fn(); // prints 0
  
   Explanation:
   child() was created inside parent()
   So child gets access to count
   Even after parent() finishes, JS keeps count alive
   Calling fn() still prints the value → this is closure
