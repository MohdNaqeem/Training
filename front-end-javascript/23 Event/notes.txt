=> What is Event:
   A browser-generated notification that something has occurred (like click, scroll, keypress), which JavaScript can listen to and 
   respond with predefined actions.

=> Event Listener:
   A function that waits for an event and executes code when that exact event happens.

=> Why Events Exist:
   Without events, a webpage is dead. Buttons wouldn’t work, forms wouldn’t submit, menus wouldn’t open — nothing would respond.

=> What is the Event Object:
   The event object is a special JavaScript object automatically created by the browser every time an event happens.
   It contains full information about what happened, where it happened, and how it happened.

=> removeEventListener:
   removeEventListener() is a DOM method used to remove an event listener that was attached with addEventListener(), preventing the 
   callback function from executing when the event occurs. It requires the exact same event type and function reference used during 
   registration.
