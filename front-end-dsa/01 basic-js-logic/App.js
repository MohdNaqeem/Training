/*
here we will get 0 because minus(-) operator use for substract and here one is string and one is number so minus operator only 
use for number so Js engine will convert from string to number sp that's why we got 0. this process known as Type coercian 

1) + (plus) operator it use for addition and as well as concatenation, when both value will be number so it will work for addition otherwise 
it will concatenate

2) - (minus) operator it use only for substract 

3) * (multiply) operator also use only for multiply 

so if one value would be string and one would be number so js engine will convert string into number in the case of minus and 
multiply

so here we are using number function to convert data type from string to number. and here prompt used as a paranthesis and we

Number => string
string => number
boolean => string

so we have to swap two variable value, and to achieve this task we are using extra variable

and then in second variable we are putting the value of extra variable because it has first variable value

/*

This program swaps the values of two variables using destructuring assignment in JavaScript.
The line [demo, demo2] = [demo2, demo]; swaps their values.
The left hand side value was [40,50]
The right side [demo2, demo] means [50, 40].
Then, demo becomes 50 and demo2 becomes 40.

// => Operators and their question 

let num = 7;

console.log(num/num2) // Ans 3.5

/* 

And most imp thing when we divide two digit so after that we get two parts, 01 Quotient and 02 Remainder

01 Quotient : The main result of the division (how many times one number fits into another).
02 Remainder : What is left over after dividing.

Division sign(/) always gives Quotient.

Example:
console.log(Math.floor(7/2)) 
Output: 3 , because 2 can divide 7, 3 times and rest of numbers would be remainder so here remainder is 1

mod sign(%) always gives Remainder. 
console.log(7%2) Ans 1

*/

let remainder = 10
let remainder2 = 20

console.log(Math.floor(remainder/remainder2)) // Ans 0

/*

For modulus sign(%)
So left side value known as dividend and right side value is division. 10/20 , 10 is dividend and 20 is division.
so when we are using mod sign and our dividend is smaller than division then actual dividend number would be Ans

For division sign(/)
If dividend is smaller than division then ans would be 0.

*/

let sum = 4569;
console.log(sum%10) // Ans 9, 

// For divide
let sum2 = 7023
let sum3 = 10

/* 

For the modulus sign (%): 
whenever we mod a number by 10, the last digit will be the remainder; for 100, the last two digits will be the remainder; 
and for 1000, the last three digits will be the remainder.

And basically we use this trick to get last digit value.

For division sign(/):
When we divide a number by 10, the last digit is removed from the number.
