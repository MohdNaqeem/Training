/*

There are two types of increment and decremaent.

1- Post Increment and post decrement 
2- Pre Increment and pre decrement 

Post-Increment (i++):
Increases the value after using it.

Pre-Increment (++i):
Increases the value before using it.

Post-Decrement (i--):
Decreases the value after using it.

Pre-Decrement (--i):
Decreases the value before using it.

And we can only use operator on variable not on constant value.

Example:
let a = ++10, this will give error because we are using operator on constant value.

let boolean = true

console.log(boolean)
