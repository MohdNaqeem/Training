    <h1>05 Javascript short logic</h1>
    <script>
        let a = 108
        let b = new Number(108)
        let c = 108;

        console.log(a == b)
        console.log(a === b)
        console.log(b === c)
        console.log(a === c)
    </script>
    <!--
    
    Explanation :

    in this logic we have 3 variable in first variable we have type number in second we have number type
    of object and in third we have type number. 
    
    Output :
    1 - true 
    2 - false
    3 - false

    in first console we comparing a variable with b variable with == so == just compare the value
    it's not compare data type it's just compare value so both valur are same so that's why we got
    true

    in second console we comparing a variable with b variable with === so === compare value and data type
    both so both value is same but a variable type is number and b variable type is number object so that's
    why we got false

    in third console we comparing b variable with c variable with === so === compare value and data type
    both so both value is same but c variable type is number and b variable type is number object so that's
    why we got false

    in fourt console we comparing a variable with c variable with === so in these variable value and type
    both are same so tht's why we got true
