    <script>
        function showData(){
            console.log("Name of user : ", name)
            console.log("age of user : ", age)
            var name = "Naqeem";

    <!--
        Explanation :

        in this logic we are accessing variable before the initialise this is called hoisting.

        so in the case of var variable when we access variable before the initialise then all the var variable
        move on top of the function so that's why we will get undefined.

        but in the case of let it doesn't happen that's why we will get error.
