    <h1>04 Javascript short logic</h1>
    <script>
     console.log(+true)
     console.log(!"Javascript")
    </script>
    <!--
        This logic is related to uniary operator in this logic we have used plus(+) operator 
    
    Explanation :
    
    in this logic we have 2 console.
    1 - console.log(+true)
    2 - console.log(!"Javascript")

    in first console we use plus operator with boolean value(true) when we use plus operator with any data
    type so plus operator always try to convert that data type in number so that's why we got 1 in this
    console.

    in second console we use negation(!) operator, when we use negation operator with any data type then
    it convert that data type into opposite boolean so in this console (!"Javascript") we using negation 
    with string which is true so that's why we got false in this console.
