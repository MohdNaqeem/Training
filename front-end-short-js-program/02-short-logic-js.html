    <script>

        for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 5)
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 5)

    <!-- 
    in this logic we are printin number using for loop. using var and let.
    
    in this logic in the case of var we got 4 times 4, but in the case of let we got 4 different value.

    Explanation :

    in the case of var we got 4 times 4 because the declaration of var move on top of the function and each timeout
    refer common i variable so when for loop will be over it will print the final value of var.

    but in the case of let we got 4 different value because declaration of let doesn't hoist so
    that's why we got 4 different values.

    This concept we called hoisting.
